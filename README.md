You've probably been to an event where the big screen wasn't just showing slides or logos... it was showing you. That's a social media wall — a live feed of posts, photos, and videos from your guests. And trust me, once people see their face or their post up there, they keep posting.

It's not just a cool tech gimmick — it's a real way to:
- Make your audience feel part of the event
- Create buzz
- Collect content you can use later

But with so many tools out there, picking the right one can be a headache. Don't worry, I've done the digging for you. Here are 7 social media wall tools that actually work and make your event look like it's been planned by a pro.

## 1. Socialwalls.com – Quick, Easy & Crowd-Friendly

If you just want something that works without hours of setup, Socialwalls.com is worth your first look. It can instantly turn your event screen into a live Instagram wall, pulling in posts from Instagram, TikTok, Twitter (X), Facebook, and more, then showing them off in a clean, branded display. Guests without social media? No problem — they can scan a QR code and upload directly.

**What makes it great:**
- Live social feed updates in seconds
- QR code uploads for offline participants
- Themes and branding that match your event style
- Simple controls to approve posts before they appear

**Good for:**  
Corporate events, virtual events, product launches, signage, weddings, music nights — pretty much anything where you want people to feel part of the event, not just watching it.

💡 **Pro tip:** Try the polls and leaderboards during breaks — it keeps people engaged instead of staring at their phones.

## 2. Taggbox – For Customisation Fans

Some organisers like to set it and forget it. Others... want every colour, font, and animation just so. If you're in the second group, Taggbox is your friend. It works with social media platforms, review sites, and even lets you display UGC on your website after the event.

**Why it works:**
- Fully customisable themes and layouts
- Connects to social and review platforms
- Filters and moderation tools to keep the wall clean

**Good for:**  
Brands that want everything on-screen to match their identity perfectly.

## 3. Walls.io – Keep It Simple (and Multilingual)

If you don't want a tool that requires a tech degree, Walls.io is as straightforward as it gets. And if your event has people posting in different languages, it handles that too.

**Perks:**
- Set it up in minutes
- Works with 13+ platforms
- Supports multiple languages without fuss

**Good for:**  
International conferences, expos, or festivals where your crowd is posting in more than one language.

## 4. Everwall – Fast for Big Crowds

Everwall is built for busy events — sports matches, big concerts, massive conferences — where posts are coming in every few seconds.

**Why it's solid:**
- Almost instant updates
- Handles huge post volumes without lag
- Analytics to measure engagement

**Good for:**  
Events where speed matters and the wall will be constantly buzzing.

## 5. Tint – Turn Posts Into Stories

Tint isn't just about showing what's new — it's about curating posts into a story. It pulls from social media, review sites, and even internal channels, so it works beyond just event day.

**Highlights:**
- Beautiful storytelling layouts
- Pulls from many content sources
- Good analytics for campaign tracking

**Good for:**  
Brands that want the wall to be part of their marketing content, not just a live display.

## 6. Onstipe – Affordable & No-Frills

If you need a budget-friendly option that still looks good, Onstipe delivers. It's straightforward, works offline if needed, and won't burn through your budget.

**Why it's handy:**
- Cheaper plans for small events
- Drag-and-drop layouts
- Offline display mode for patchy Wi-Fi venues

**Good for:**  
Community events, small weddings, school functions, and anyone looking for a cost-effective solution.

## 7. LiveWall – Big Brand Energy

LiveWall is less of a plug-and-play tool and more of a creative service. They design walls that are part of bigger experiences — think AR games, filters, and immersive displays.

**What's cool:**
- Fully customised builds
- Can integrate interactive elements
- Great for marketing activations

**Good for:**  
Festivals, concerts, where you want something people remember.

## Picking the Right One

When you're choosing, think about:
- **Size of your event** – Small gathering or massive crowd?
- **How social your audience is** – Do they need QR uploads?
- **Your internet connection** – Offline mode might be a lifesaver
- **How much branding you need** – Simple or fully on-brand?
- **Budget** – Prices range from "cheap and cheerful" to "big brand spend"

## Why Bother With a Social Wall?

Because they do more than look pretty:
- People engage more when they see themselves on-screen
- Every post is free promo for your event
- Creates a sense of community in the room
- Gives you a bank of real, authentic content
- Sponsors love the extra exposure

## Final Take

A social wall is like giving your event a live heartbeat — you can feel it when it's there. Whether you go for:
- The plug-and-play speed of Socialwalls.com
- The endless custom options of Taggbox
- The fully immersive approach of LiveWall

The right choice will keep your guests posting, sharing, and remembering the day long after it's over.
